# mdmarkup - Markdown Annotations and Formatting

A [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) extension for Visual Studio Code with [CriticMarkup](https://github.com/CriticMarkup/CriticMarkup-toolkit) support.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- **Multi-line preview rendering**: Multi-line patterns only render correctly in preview when they start at the **beginning of a line**. Patterns starting mid-line won't render, but **navigation commands work for patterns at any position**.

- **TextMate syntax highlighting**: VS Code's TextMate grammar has limitations with complex multi-line patterns. While syntax highlighting is provided, very long patterns may not highlight perfectly across all lines.

- **Nested patterns**: CriticMarkup patterns cannot be nested. Only the first complete pattern is recognized.

- **Unclosed patterns**: Patterns without proper closing markup (e.g., `{++text without closing`) appear as literal text.

## Development

See [Development](docs/development.md).

## Provenance

This project began as a fork of the archived [vscode-criticmarkup](https://github.com/jloow/vscode-criticmarkup) extension by Joel Lööw (2019), which provided CriticMarkup syntax highlighting and snippets. This version represents an architectural rewrite that extends the original with multi-line patterns, live preview, formatting tools, and comprehensive testing.
