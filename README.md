# Scientific Markdown

A specification, converter, and VS Code extension for roundtrip manuscript and documentation editing between [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and Microsoft Word. Preserves change tracking, comments, tables, [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) equations, and citations in both directions, including [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) bibliographic data.

## Background

- Wanted plain-text editing for manuscripts
- Found [CriticMarkup](https://github.com/CriticMarkup/CriticMarkup-toolkit) and a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/jloow/vscode-criticmarkup) for it, which were used as starting points
- Needed a more comprehensive spec, and a converter, to collaborate with people who use Word and Zotero

## What It Is

1. A **specification** extending Markdown + CriticMarkup + Pandoc
2. A **converter** (DOCX ↔ Markdown)
3. A **VS Code extension**

**New to VS Code or Markdown?** The [Getting Started guide](docs/intro.md) walks you through everything from installation to your first document — no prior experience with code editors or plain-text tools required.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install from the [releases page](https://github.com/jbearak/scimark/releases), or [build from source](docs/development.md). 

<!-- Download from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jbearak.scimark), (OpenVSX Registry)[https://open-vsx.org/extension/jbearak/scimark], -->

### Usage

- **Annotations**: Click **Markdown Annotations** in the toolbar or right-click menu for comment, highlight, addition, deletion, and substitution marks
- **Formatting**: Click **Markdown Formatting** for bold, italic, lists, headings, links, code, and table reflow
- **DOCX Conversion**: Right-click a `.docx` file and select **Export to Markdown**, or use the **Export to Word** submenu to convert Markdown back to DOCX
- **Navigation**: Use `Alt+Shift+J` / `Alt+Shift+K` to jump between changes

### CLI

A standalone CLI tool is also available for terminal-based conversion. See [CLI Tool](docs/cli.md) for details.

```sh
scimark paper.docx    # DOCX → Markdown
scimark paper.md      # Markdown → DOCX
```
