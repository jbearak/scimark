# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds equation/math support to the existing DOCX-to-Markdown converter. DOCX files store equations using OMML (Office Math Markup Language) within `w:oMath` and `w:oMathPara` elements. The converter shall translate these into LaTeX notation embedded in Markdown using `$...$` for inline equations and `$$...$$` for display (block) equations.

## Glossary

- **Converter**: The DOCX-to-Markdown conversion module in `src/converter.ts`
- **OMML**: Office Math Markup Language, the XML-based equation format used in DOCX files
- **Inline_Equation**: An equation appearing within a paragraph of text, rendered using `$...$` delimiters
- **Display_Equation**: A standalone equation on its own line, rendered using `$$...$$` delimiters
- **LaTeX_Notation**: The mathematical typesetting syntax used to represent equations in Markdown
- **OMML_Element**: An XML element in the DOCX document representing a math construct (e.g., fractions, superscripts, radicals)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Inline Equation Conversion

**User Story:** As a user converting a DOCX file, I want inline equations to appear as `$...$` LaTeX in the Markdown output, so that math expressions remain readable and renderable within paragraph text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Converter encounters a `w:oMath` element inside a paragraph, THE Converter SHALL emit the equation as an Inline_Equation wrapped in `$...$` delimiters
2. WHEN an Inline_Equation appears adjacent to text, THE Converter SHALL preserve surrounding text and spacing so the equation integrates naturally into the sentence
3. WHEN an Inline_Equation contains only a plain text variable or number, THE Converter SHALL still wrap the content in `$...$` delimiters

### Requirement 2: Display Equation Conversion

**User Story:** As a user converting a DOCX file, I want display (block) equations to appear as `$$...$$` LaTeX in the Markdown output, so that standalone equations are rendered prominently on their own line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Converter encounters a `w:oMathPara` element, THE Converter SHALL emit the equation as a Display_Equation wrapped in `$$...$$` delimiters on its own line
2. WHEN a Display_Equation is emitted, THE Converter SHALL separate the `$$...$$` block from surrounding content with blank lines

### Requirement 3: OMML-to-LaTeX Translation

**User Story:** As a user converting a DOCX file, I want OMML math constructs translated into correct LaTeX notation, so that the equations render accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Converter encounters an `m:f` (fraction) element, THE Converter SHALL emit `\frac{numerator}{denominator}` in LaTeX_Notation
2. WHEN the Converter encounters an `m:sSup` (superscript) element, THE Converter SHALL emit `base^{exponent}` in LaTeX_Notation
3. WHEN the Converter encounters an `m:sSub` (subscript) element, THE Converter SHALL emit `base_{subscript}` in LaTeX_Notation
4. WHEN the Converter encounters an `m:sSubSup` (sub-superscript) element, THE Converter SHALL emit `base_{subscript}^{superscript}` in LaTeX_Notation
5. WHEN the Converter encounters an `m:rad` (radical) element with no explicit degree, THE Converter SHALL emit `\sqrt{radicand}` in LaTeX_Notation
6. WHEN the Converter encounters an `m:rad` (radical) element with an explicit degree, THE Converter SHALL emit `\sqrt[degree]{radicand}` in LaTeX_Notation
7. WHEN the Converter encounters an `m:nary` (n-ary operator) element, THE Converter SHALL emit the appropriate operator (e.g., `\sum`, `\prod`, `\int`) with subscript and superscript limits in LaTeX_Notation
8. WHEN the Converter encounters an `m:d` (delimiter/parentheses) element, THE Converter SHALL emit the content wrapped in the specified opening and closing delimiters in LaTeX_Notation
9. WHEN the Converter encounters an `m:acc` (accent) element, THE Converter SHALL emit the corresponding LaTeX accent command (e.g., `\hat`, `\bar`, `\dot`) in LaTeX_Notation
10. WHEN the Converter encounters an `m:m` (matrix) element, THE Converter SHALL emit a LaTeX matrix environment with rows separated by `\\` and columns separated by `&`
11. WHEN the Converter encounters an `m:func` (function) element, THE Converter SHALL emit the function name followed by its argument in LaTeX_Notation
12. WHEN the Converter encounters an `m:r` (math run) element containing text, THE Converter SHALL emit the text content, applying italic formatting for single-letter variables by default
13. WHEN the Converter encounters nested OMML_Elements, THE Converter SHALL recursively translate each element and compose the LaTeX output correctly

### Requirement 4: Special Characters and Symbols

**User Story:** As a user converting a DOCX file, I want Greek letters, operators, and special math symbols to appear as their LaTeX equivalents, so that the full range of mathematical notation is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Converter encounters a Unicode Greek letter in an OMML_Element, THE Converter SHALL emit the corresponding LaTeX command (e.g., `α` becomes `\alpha`, `Ψ` becomes `\Psi`)
2. WHEN the Converter encounters a Unicode math operator or symbol in an OMML_Element, THE Converter SHALL emit the corresponding LaTeX command (e.g., `×` becomes `\times`, `≤` becomes `\leq`)
3. WHEN the Converter encounters a character that has no specific LaTeX command equivalent, THE Converter SHALL emit the character directly in the LaTeX output

### Requirement 5: OMML-to-LaTeX Round Trip Fidelity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want confidence that the OMML-to-LaTeX translation is structurally faithful, so that the converter produces correct output for arbitrary equations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. FOR ALL valid OMML trees, converting to LaTeX and re-parsing the LaTeX SHALL produce a structurally equivalent mathematical expression (round-trip property)
2. WHEN the Converter translates an OMML tree to LaTeX, THE Converter SHALL produce syntactically valid LaTeX that contains balanced braces and correct command usage

### Requirement 6: Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user converting a DOCX file, I want the converter to handle malformed or unsupported equation markup gracefully, so that conversion does not fail entirely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the Converter encounters an unrecognized OMML_Element, THEN THE Converter SHALL emit the plain text content of that element as a fallback
2. IF the Converter encounters an OMML_Element with missing required children, THEN THE Converter SHALL emit an empty placeholder and continue conversion
3. IF the Converter encounters an empty `w:oMath` or `w:oMathPara` element, THEN THE Converter SHALL skip the element without emitting delimiters
